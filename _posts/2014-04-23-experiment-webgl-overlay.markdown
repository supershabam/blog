I have a vision for bringing back the true purpose of javascript: trailing mouse cursor effects.

It's time to rethink how annoying cursor effects can be now that we have WebGL. We can have some pretty [particle systems](http://minimal.be/lab/fluGL/) following the mouse around.

First, I need to test if I can overlay a WebGL view over the browser viewport and make it so that the mouse "clicks through" to the content underneath.

If that proves true, I'll start my quest of bringing javascript back to the trolls of the internet instead of the hipsters and problem-solvers.
