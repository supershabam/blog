<div class="post">
<p>For Node Knockout 2013, I finally sat down and built out an idea I&#39;d had for a while: polysocket.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve held a gripe against socket.io for a long time. I was interested in WebSockets for a long time (even writing one of the first, but now abandoned, WebSocket parsers for NodeJS back when the spec changed every week).</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t like socket.io because it wasn&#39;t websockets. Sure, it helped other browsers keep up with the &quot;realtime&quot; hotness, but we are now speaking the &quot;socket.io&quot; protocol instead of websockets.</p>

<p>Then, I used socket.io in a client project and it couldn&#39;t handle a medium amount of load since it communicated state across a poor overloaded redis pubsub channel.</p>

<p>Even though supporting IE6 is no longer a big deal, I wanted to prove that we could build a WebSocket polyfill that would transparently upgrade browsers.</p>

<p>This polyfill is perhaps trickier than other polyfills because there are two sides: the browser and the server. I want the browser to have &quot;WebSockets&quot; and the server to ONLY serve pure WebSockets (not socket.io channels, or sockjs channels, or [insert realtime lib here] channels).</p>

<p>JUST WEBSOCKETS!</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://twitter.com/taterbase">taterbase</a> and I built it. We built it in just a few hours too.</p>
